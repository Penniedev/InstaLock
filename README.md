## Features

### Agent Instalock
Automatically selects your preferred agent the moment the selection phase begins, ensuring you never lose your main pick again.

**Important:**  
Use this feature responsibly. Excessive automation during competitive play can negatively impact team dynamics and may be flagged by Riot’s systems if abused.

---

### Shop Monitor
Stay updated with your daily shop rotation and featured bundles.  
Receive notifications when desired skins become available — all without leaving your client.

---

### Account Overview
Access a clean, unified dashboard displaying your Valorant profile data and match details.  
Information is retrieved securely through Riot’s local client API, with no external servers or credentials involved.

---

## Security and Privacy

Instalocker communicates exclusively with the **local Riot lockfile** used by the game client.  
- No credentials, tokens, or personal data are stored or transmitted.  
- No third-party APIs or remote endpoints are accessed.  
- All operations occur locally on your machine.

This architecture ensures complete privacy and eliminates the need for external authentication.
